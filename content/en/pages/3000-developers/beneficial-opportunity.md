  title: Beneficial opportunity for Dapps developers
---

When developing a Dapp using Dev Protocol, there are several main models of beneficial opportunities you can get:

- **Receive part of a Property(a.k.a. Creator Token)**

  - If your Dapp is beneficial to creators, you can require them to deposit a part of a Property to take advantage of Dapp. If Dapp owns 1% of the Property, Dapp will receive 1% of creator rewards.

- **Transaction fees**

  - If your Dapp provides an aggregator or a new UX, you can collect a DEV as a fee when staking or withdrawing rewards.

- **Staking**

  - If your Dapp itself is a Property, you can request staking for using the Dapp.

- **...And unknown Lego**
  - Dev Protocol is an on-chain middleware protocol! You are free to combine it as part of a Lego block.
